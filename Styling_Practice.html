        <p>Bill Walsh’s 1984 San Francisco 49ers went 15-1 during the regular season and beat the Dolphins, 38-16 in Super Bowl XIX. The 49ers, who had the NFL’s second best offense and top defense, outscored their opponents 475 to 227 during the regular season and 82 to 26 in the playoffs. 
            Quarterback Joe Montana (3,630 yards passing, 28 TDs), running backs Wendell Tyler (1,492 yards from scrimmage, 9 TDs) and Roger Craig (1,324 yards from scrimmage, 10 TDs); and wide receiver Freddie Solomon (10 receiving TDs) led the offense. 
            While four starters in the secondary; Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks and Carlton Williamson were all selected to the Pro Bowl. In the postseason, the Niners beat the Giants, 21-10 and the Bears, 23-0 to reach the Super Bowl. 
            In that game, the 49ers faced the 14-2 Dolphins, who had the NFL’s best offense and league MVP in Dan Marino. The Niners held Miami to a season-low 16 points, while Montana threw for 331 yards and three TDs and was named MVP.</p>
